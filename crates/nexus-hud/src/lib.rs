//! Elite Dangerous HUD colours.
//!
//! * [`matrix`]: the 3×3 colour matrix the game recolours its interface with, how it maps a
//!   colour ([`HudMatrix::apply`]) and how simple controls (hue, saturation, brightness) build one.
//! * [`override_file`]: reading and surgically writing `GraphicsConfigurationOverride.xml`, where
//!   the game looks for a commander's own colours (read at launch only).
//! * [`palette`]: the game's standard interface colours, for previews, [`palette::concerns`]:
//!   what a matrix makes hard to see (friend and foe merging, a HUD too dark to read), and
//!   [`palette::is_hud_orange`]: which colours the HUD colour protection lets the theme change.
//! * [`presets`]: community themes, credited.
//! * [`install`]: the game's install folders and whether a shader mod (EDHM) is in one.
//! * [`tone`]: glare and exposure, the tone-mapping values in the same file.
//! * [`dimmer`]: Elite Nexus's graphics hook, 3Dmigoto with fixes for the cockpit-light dimmer (the
//!   game's box-light shader) and the HUD colour protection (the HUD shaders that apply the colour
//!   matrix), made from the commander's own game in a calibration and loaded by fingerprint.
