//! Elite Dangerous player journal access for Elite Nexus.
//!
//! * [`paths`] — finding the journal and bindings folders, ordering journal files.
//! * [`raw`] — allocation-free pre-scan of a line's timestamp and event name.
//! * [`events`] — typed events (`Event::parse` only parses events Elite Nexus models).
//! * [`companion`] — Status.json, Market.json, Cargo.json, NavRoute.json, …
//! * [`reader`] — parallel bulk loading of historical journals.
//! * [`watcher`] — live tailing with ~100 ms latency.
